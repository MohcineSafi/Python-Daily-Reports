### Python Script for Sending Daily Reports

1. **Install the required libraries**:

   ```sh
   pip install schedule
   ```

### Setup Instructions:

1. **Environment Preparation**:

   - Install Python on your machine if it is not already installed.
   - Install the required libraries with the command `pip install schedule`.

2. **Configure the settings**:

   - Replace `your_email@example.com` with your email address.
   - Replace `your_password` with your email password. (Use an app-specific password if available for security reasons).
   - Change `recipient@example.com` to the recipient's email address.
   - Adjust `smtp.example.com` and `587` with your email provider's SMTP details.

3. **Creating the Report**:

   - Ensure that the file `path_to_daily_report.txt` exists and contains the daily report. You can generate this file via another script or application.

4. **Running the Script**:

   - Run the Python script. It will schedule the sending of the daily report at the specified time (here, 08:00).
   - The script uses an infinite loop to stay active and regularly check if the sending time is reached.

### Additional Remarks:

- For more reliable deployment, you can use services like `cron` on Unix/Linux to run the script daily without needing to keep it running continuously.
- To enhance security, consider using email services that support OAuth2 or app-specific passwords.

By following these steps, you will be able to automate the sending of daily reports via email using Python.
